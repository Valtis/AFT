"""
Module for the topology builder class, which builds device topology file

Currently has several assumptions on devices and file locations:

-Dmesg log is cleared during topology building
-USB relay cutters must be entered manually as currently they are not detected
-Assumes that topology builder config file is /etc/aft/topology_builder.json
-Assumes that topology config file is /etc/aft/devices/topology.cfg

-Every device must have an operating system present that:
    * For PC-like devices, negotiates IP through DHCP
    * Responds to ping
    * After booting, the operating system is in a state where any keystrokes
      sent over serial port (for devices that have serial port attached) can be
      immediately read back over serial port

-DHCP-leases are stored in /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
-Edison registration shows up in dmesg log, in a certain form
